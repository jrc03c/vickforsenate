<h1 class="title">Cannabis Reform</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I will support legislation to legalize possession and use of cannabis and its derivatives and to regulate its production, sale and use.</li>

  <li>I will support the taxation and state regulation of cannabis sales with that revenue earmarked for local mental health, drug treatment, and veterans housing.</li>

  <li>Scientific and medical studies identify cannabis as a viable treatment option for epilepsy, PTSD, and other ailments, therefore I support the expansion of legal medical cannabis.</li>

  <li>I will call for release of individuals incarcerated for possession of cannabis and expungement of criminal records of persons convicted or receiving Deferred Adjudication for misdemeanor cannabis offenses.</li>
</ul>

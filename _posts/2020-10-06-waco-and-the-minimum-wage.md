My congratulations to the members of the Waco City Council and McLennan County Commission on their recent approval; 1) the incentives for Texas Meter & Device, contingent of their preserving the 60 local manufacturing positions and continuance of the $12/hour minimum wage, and 2) raising the wage threshold for future grant applicants to pay a $15/hour minimum wage, and an overall average wage of $17.50/hour. 

This is what forward thinking governance looks like. The Economic Development Corporation has produced recognizable and measurable benefits to Waco and McLennan County for years. 

While this (and similar economic sweeteners) is a step in the right direction, their limitations quickly become apparent. By tying a higher minimum wage to the economic assistance given businesses that apply, they help some of our workers. But to help all, our city council would have to mandate a raise in the minimum wage, throughout the city. And that they can’t do.

The Texas Labor Code, the state law that governs the minimum wage says that the state minimum wage supersedes any wage set by city or county ordinance.

Although the city council knows that the cost of living in Waco is far greater than, say, Progreso, a small city in the Valley, they can do nothing about it. Even though many, if not most of our “essential workers” have to supplement their earning through public assistance, they can’t address the root cause, the minimum wage. This leaves us, the taxpayers, to subsidize the employers’ wages for their staffs.

It’s no wonder businesses howl when minimum wages are hiked – they lose that “subsidy” and have to pay a wage commensurate with the true value to their workers.

Another insidious effect of the current model – where employers pay only about half of the “living wage” their workers require - is the stifling of these workers’ ambitions. As they develop more and better skills any merit increase in pay is met with a decrease in the public assistance they receive. For every promotion, they effectively receive a net zero increase in their compensation. You don’t have to know a lot about human nature to see that we are dis-incentivizing our minimum wage workers from working their way out of poverty. This is not how capitalism is supposed to work.

So what’s the fix?

Simply, we need a state legislature that will raise the minimum wage to a *living wage*. Such a raise, to $15/hour, would raise the pay of 43% of all the workers in McLennan County. It is a truism of economics that “we all do better when we all do better”. 

Imagine the shot in the arm such a raise will give this economy! A raise for the people that actually spend their money, not bank it off-shore.

The roadblock to raising the minimum wage is in our State Senate. Because the Republicans hold a “supermajority” they don’t have to act upon bills passed by the House. They can ignore them. But if they lose that supermajority, those bills have to be addressed on the floor of the Senate...and voted upon. And that’s how we hold our Senators accountable.

To eliminate that Senate supermajority, we have to flip just one seat from the Republicans to the Democrats. That’s why I’m running to be your Texas State Senator for this district. To flip that seat and work to raise the minimum wage.

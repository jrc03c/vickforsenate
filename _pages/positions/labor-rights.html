<h1 class="title">Good Wages, Benefits and Safe Working Conditions</h1>

<ul>
  <li>There should be no classification called "working poor". No Texan should be paid poverty level wages that require him or her to rely on public assistance to make ends meet. I support legislation that requires a living wage of $15-an-hour.</li>

  <li>I oppose so-called "right-to-work" laws and support unions and the value they bring to the Texas economy.</li>

  <li>I support equal pay for equal work.</li>

  <li>I support equal access for women of all ages to training, jobs and promotions, and the right to address grievances for equal pay, capital, equity and contracts.</li>

  <li>I support the expansion of workplace rights such as flex time, comp time, workplace time (for child nursing, etc.) and paid family leave in all employment contracts.</li>

  <li>I support paid sick leave for all Texas workers.</li>

  <li>I support policies that create meaningful consequences for employers who commit wage theft or who misclassify their workers to avoid paying taxes, workmenâ€™s comp, and/or benefits.</li>
</ul>

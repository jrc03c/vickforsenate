<h1 class="title">Criminal Justice Reform</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I will support legislation that prohibits State and local governments from contracting with private prisons, jails, and detention facilities.</li>

  <li>We must soundly reject and replace the excruciatingly unfair money bail system and replace it with a risk-assessment bail system.</li>

  <li>I support enacting legislation that requires people suspected of minor, non-violent misdemeanors be issued a summons to appear in court rather than placed under arrest.</li>

  <li>I believe ex-offenders should have more access to rehabilitation and re-entry programs and support reversing policies that deny student loans and grants to those who have completed their sentence.</li>

  <li>I support efforts to place a stronger emphasis on compensation to crime victims by the criminals themselves.</li>

  <li>I will support legislation that treats drug use as a public health challenge rather than a crime.</li>
</ul>

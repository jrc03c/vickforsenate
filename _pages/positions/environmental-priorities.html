<h1 class="title">Environmental Priorities</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I will champion legislation to utilize our wealth of alternative energy sources, solar, wind and geothermal.</li>

  <li>I will work to restore the rights of local governments and voters to regulate oil and gas operations within their communities.</li>

  <li>I will support legislation to strengthen and enforce regulations designed to rapidly and significantly reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations.</li>

  <li>I support an aggressive phasing out of the ecologically destructive extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing.</li>

  <li>The State must take immediate action to prevent the depletion and exploitation of our water resources by banning the use of non-brackish water for fracking, requiring practical recovery of water used in the fracking process (sometimes in the millions of gallons per well), and an end to speculative water marketing.</li>

  <li>Texas needs to fully enforce environmental laws instead of ceding its responsibility to protect our health to corporate interests.</li>

  <li>I support increased funding for the upkeep, maintenance and acquisition of State Park land.</li>

  <li>I support programs that encourage the reduction of "single use" plastics.</li>

  <li>I will oppose any further attempts of the Legislature aimed at preventing cities and counties from regulating litter and pollution in their boundaries.</li>
</ul>

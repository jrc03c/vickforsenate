<h1 class="title">Support for Teachers, both Active and Retired</h1>

<ul>
  <li>We should bring Texas teacher pay in line with the national average.</li>

  <li>We must increase the state contribution to health insurance for educational employees, which has remained stagnant for 14 years while premium costs have eaten away at take home pay for teachers and other school employees.</li>

  <li>I will protect the Teacher Retirement System against attempts to turn it into a risky 401(k) plan that could put retirees' pensions in danger.</li>

  <li>I believe we should provide a regular cost of living increase for every educational employee.</li>
</ul>

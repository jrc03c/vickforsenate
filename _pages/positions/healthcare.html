<h1 class="title">Improving Health Care for All Texans</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I believe that accepting the billions of federal dollars for the State's Medicaid program can provide coverage and keep Texans out of the emergency room where they often cannot afford to pay their bills and would stop those costs from being passed on to Texans through higher insurance premiums and property taxes.</li>

  <li>I will advocate restoring a fee-for-service model and reject further "privatization" efforts to the Texas Medicaid program.</li>

  <li>I will defend Medicare provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that improves our quality of care and increases services to rural areas.</li>

  <li>I support increasing community-based mental health services for children and adults.</li>

  <li>Legislation and efforts to combat the State's maternal mortality crisis must become a priority.</li>

  <li>I trust Texans to make personal and responsible decisions about whether and when to bear children, in consultation with their families, physicians, personal consciences or faith. I will oppose any and all legislation that infringes upon these rights.</li>

  <li>I support targeted efforts to reduce our high rates of teen pregnancy, including the provision of evidence-based, accurate and effective, comprehensive, age-appropriate sex education programs with abstinence and contraception components.</li>
</ul>
